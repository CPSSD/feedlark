CONTRIBUTING.md
===============




Branches
--------

Branches are named like so:

    category/assignee/name#issue_number

#### Categories:

- `feature/...` -- for code related items
- `doc/...` -- for documentation items
- `bugfix/...` -- for bug fixes




Pull Requests
-------------

Changes to the repository are made on other branches and merged onto the
`master` branch.


#### Formatting Pull Requests

Your pull request body you should have this text:

    This pull request connects to #issue_number

With the previous example this would be:

    This pull request connects to #1

This prevents waffle from opening a separate issue for pull requests.


#### Code Reviews

The code **must** be reviewed before it is merged by at least one team
member.

Preferably a few team members should okay the pull request before it gets
merged.
