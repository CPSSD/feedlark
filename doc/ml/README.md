Machine Learning Methods
========================

Our number one concern is speed of deployment, as we do not want to get bogged down in the theory of machine learning; that could take months or years to understand and implement.

As such, we chose to use an off-the-shelf solution. We considered several options, such as `SmileMiner` (Java), `Apache Spark` (Scala, Java, Python) and `Orange` (Python), however, we chose to use `scikit-learn` for the following reasons:

- It is in Python, so it is accessable to any member of the team
- It is a mature, well-supported and fully-featured library
- It has support for on-line learning models
